The ULIB is an efficient algorithm library for C and C++.
ULIB consists of components in multithreading, parallel computing, data indexing, numerical approximation, and cryptography.

Some building blocks are based on other open-source projects, such as the Linux kernel. Please refer to the copyright of the specific source code files.
